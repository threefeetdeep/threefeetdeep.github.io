      <description>R MarkdownThroughout my ongoing journey of discovery and learning instatistics and data science , my mainstay computing environment has been the R Studio IDE.
I found initially that it is quite hard to include R markdown output in blogging sites like Wordpress. This led me to create my own website from scratch (in simple HTML,CSS and Javascript) but this rapidly become cumbersome to maintain, even as a static site.</description>

      <description>When I first started learning R early in 2020, it cames as a bit of a suprise that there were functions in base R for calculating the mean and median, but not the mode. Well, there is a function mode(), but it returns the storage mode of an R object!
Of course, the mean only operates on numeric data, as does the R median() function. But we could take the mode of a collection of pretty much any objects, numeric, factor, or otherwise.</description>
