      <description>My first foray into reinforcement learningSupervised and unsupervised learning are the backbone of today’s machine learning solutions, but reinforcement learning is the technique that makes you envisage androids, Terminator, Skynet, and the rise of the machines!
One of the “Hello World!” toy examples in reinforcement learning is to teach an computer ‘agent’ to play pong from scratch, in this case in a Python script.
Reward, or carrot and stickReinforcement learning uses principles similar to those that we might use when we humans learn.</description>

      <description>Please tell me when to cover my carWouldn’t it be nice if there was a smartphone app that alerted me the evening before a potentially frosty morning, to prompt me to go and put the covers on the car windscreen, saving me checking the forecast each day?
There wasn’t so I thought I would have a go myself. I had previously written a very basic Hello World!</description>

      <description>I recently completed the Coursera / Johns Hopkins University &amp;ldquo;Data Science Specialization&amp;rdquo;, a series of ten courses culminating in a Capstone project in which we students had to develop a text-prediction application. This was to be demonstrated in a Shiny App. Below is my &amp;ldquo;promotional slide deck&amp;rdquo; for this text-prediction application. Shiny is a powerful framework for deploying interactive R web apps, but I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit of a noob when it come&amp;rsquo;s to creating a polished app - to be worked upon!</description>
