      <description>I recently completed the Coursera / Johns Hopkins University &amp;ldquo;Data Science Specialization&amp;rdquo;, a series of ten courses culminating in a Capstone project in which we students had to develop a text-prediction application. This was to be demonstrated in a Shiny App. Below is my &amp;ldquo;promotional slide deck&amp;rdquo; for this text-prediction application. Shiny is a powerful framework for deploying interactive R web apps, but I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit of a noob when it come&amp;rsquo;s to creating a polished app - to be worked upon!</description>

      <description>When I first started learning R early in 2020, it cames as a bit of a suprise that there were functions in base R for calculating the mean and median, but not the mode. Well, there is a function mode(), but it returns the storage mode of an R object!
Of course, the mean only operates on numeric data, as does the R median() function. But we could take the mode of a collection of pretty much any objects, numeric, factor, or otherwise.</description>
