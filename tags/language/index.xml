      <description>My wife is Polish, which means she doesn’t mince her words, and can be very direct, issuing requests and commands without the usual English fluff; “Would you mind doing…”, “Could you…”, “Have you thought about doing…”.
Despite this directness of language, it turns out that the Poles have some wonderfully vivid and imaginative idioms and phrases in everyday use. I decided to document a small selection here, to give you an impression of the colourful Polish language.</description>
