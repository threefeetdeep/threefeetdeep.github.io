      <description>The ZX is not a calculatorThe ZX Spectrum played a big part in my childhood, swallowing up whole chunks of time - hours days weeks at a time - both through gaming, and painstaking programming in assembly language to create incredibly primitive games.
As I got older, and became an electronics engineer, this humble little home computer from the 1980â€™s amazed me more and more as I learnt more about its inner workings.</description>

      <description>Every now and then, especially when I&amp;rsquo;m working my way through a weeks worth of ironing, I think to myself, &amp;lsquo;is there anything I could watch on YouTube that might expand my mind a little, to ease the pain of endless ironing?&amp;rsquo;. Of course, there is. YouTube appears as an infinite repository of content, ranging from the most gloriously intriguing content to utter pointlessness. And kittens.

      <description>I recently completed the Coursera / Johns Hopkins University &amp;ldquo;Data Science Specialization&amp;rdquo;, a series of ten courses culminating in a Capstone project in which we students had to develop a text-prediction application. This was to be demonstrated in a Shiny App. Below is my &amp;ldquo;promotional slide deck&amp;rdquo; for this text-prediction application. Shiny is a powerful framework for deploying interactive R web apps, but I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit of a noob when it come&amp;rsquo;s to creating a polished app - to be worked upon!</description>
