      <description>My first foray into reinforcement learningSupervised and unsupervised learning are the backbone of today’s machine learning solutions, but reinforcement learning is the technique that makes you envisage androids, Terminator, Skynet, and the rise of the machines!
One of the “Hello World!” toy examples in reinforcement learning is to teach an computer ‘agent’ to play pong from scratch, in this case in a Python script.
Reward, or carrot and stickReinforcement learning uses principles similar to those that we might use when we humans learn.</description>

      <description>Doing a lot with a littleThe ZX Spectrum played a big part in my childhood, swallowing up whole chunks of time - hours days weeks at a time - both through gaming, and painstaking programming in assembly language to create incredibly primitive games.
As I got older, and became an electronics engineer, this humble little home computer from the 1980’s amazed me over and over as I learned more and more about its inner workings.</description>

      <description>Every now and then, especially when I&amp;rsquo;m working my way through a weeks worth of ironing, I think to myself, &amp;lsquo;is there anything I could watch on YouTube that might expand my mind a little, to ease the pain of endless ironing?&amp;rsquo;. Of course, there is. YouTube appears as an infinite repository of content, ranging from the most gloriously intriguing content to utter pointlessness. And kittens.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a little taster of the kind of YouTube content that has blown my mind&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I recently completed the Coursera / Johns Hopkins University &amp;ldquo;Data Science Specialization&amp;rdquo;, a series of ten courses culminating in a Capstone project in which we students had to develop a text-prediction application. This was to be demonstrated in a Shiny App. Below is my &amp;ldquo;promotional slide deck&amp;rdquo; for this text-prediction application. Shiny is a powerful framework for deploying interactive R web apps, but I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit of a noob when it come&amp;rsquo;s to creating a polished app - to be worked upon!</description>
