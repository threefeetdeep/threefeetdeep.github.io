      <description>When I first started learning R early in 2020, it cames as a bit of a suprise that there were functions in base R for calculating the mean and median, but not the mode. Well, there is a function mode(), but it returns the storage mode of an R object!
Of course, the mean only operates on numeric data, as does the R median() function. But we could take the mode of a collection of pretty much any objects, numeric, factor, or otherwise.</description>
