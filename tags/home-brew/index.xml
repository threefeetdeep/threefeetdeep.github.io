      <description>Needing an outdoor light by our front door, but - despite being an electronics engineer and weirdly averse to, and fearful of 240V mains electricity - I decided to create a custom battery powered Passive-Infrared (PIR) sensor and LED light. This avoided the need for drilling holes from inside to outside, and adding a stub from the indoor lighting mains ring.
I had a few old car and motorbike batteries spare.</description>
