<h2>Doing a lot with a little</h2>
<p>The ZX Spectrum played a big part in my childhood, swallowing up whole chunks of time - hours days weeks at a time - both through gaming, and painstaking programming in assembly language to create incredibly primitive games.</p>
<p>As I got older and became an electronics engineer, this humble little home computer from the 1980’s amazed me afresh as I learned more and more details about its inner workings. The functionality that the ZX Spectrum’s creators squeezed out of such a limited number of transistors, both in terms of CPU and memory, and low clock speed (3.154MHz) is simply astounding.</p>
<p>A pocket calculator has one job - to do maths - and has an incredibly specific and customized microchip “brain” for that sole purpose. The ZX spectrum was a low cost, kids’ home computer made from a general purpose microprocessor and memory chips, where mathematical manipulation had to be handled with extreme guile and care! It’s worth mentioning that the other “beating heart” of the ZX Spectrum is the unsung and mysterious Uncommitted Logic Array (ULA), something documented in a fabulous book by <a href="http://www.zxdesign.info/book/">Chris Smith</a>. However, the ULA is not discussed in this article about the mathematical magic taking place in the ZX Spectrum ROM!</p>

<div id="z80-putting-the-z-in-zx" class="section level2">
<h2>Z80: Putting the “Z” in “ZX”</h2>
<p>The digital, integer-number-crunching heart of the the ZX Spectrum is the 8-bit Zilog Z80 microprocessor, or CPU. In terms of the raw mathematical ability, it can:</p>
<ul>
<li>add or subtract 8- and 16-bit integers</li>
<li>multiply or divide 8- or 16-bit integers by powers of 2</li>
</ul>
<p>and that is pretty much it! No dedicated floating point unit, no hardware multipliers, no maths co-processor.</p>
<p>So the question is, how did such a simple home computer using a CPU with very basic mathematical abilities perform quite precise floating-point trigonometrical functions like sine, and arctangent?</p>
</div>
<div id="every-byte-counts" class="section level2">
<h2>Every byte counts</h2>
<p>The Z80 could address 64kB of memory. The ZX Spectrum has 48kB of RAM. In the remaining 16kB, the ZX Specrum had to cram the entire operating system, which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>reset/restart tables</li>
<li>tables of constants e.g. pixel maps for characters.</li>
<li>keyboard handling of key presses, scanned at 50Hz</li>
<li>loudspeaker routines to make beeps at precise frequencies</li>
<li>cassette handling for loading and saving data</li>
<li>screen and printer output handling</li>
<li>BASIC interpreter routines</li>
<li>expression evaluation routines</li>
<li>arithmetic routines</li>
<li>floating point calculator</li>
</ul>
Every single byte in ROM mattered. This becomes an important consideration when looking at how the humble ZX Spectrum handled trigonometrical and exponential functions.

<div id="floating-point-numbers-in-spectrum-land" class="section level2">
<h2>Floating-point numbers in Spectrum-Land</h2>
<p>It is worth a brief description of how the ZX Spectrum stored floating point numbers in memory using five bytes each. There’s not much point have functions like sine, cosine, log and exp if you can’t represent the answer as a decimal number!</p>
<p>Any number (except 0) can be written uniquely as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\pm mantissa \times 2^{e}\)</span></p>
<p>In the ZX Spectrum, <span class="math inline">\(mantissa\)</span> is made up of the four bytes <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(m_4\)</span>, expressed as a fractional integer, as illustrated here using only four bits after the decimal point The ZX Spectrum uses 32 bits.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../../../images/fractional_binary.gif" alt="" />
<p class="caption">image_medium</p>
</div>
<p>The Spectrum ROM code assumes that the left-most (most-significant) bit of the mantissa would be a one, limiting the mantissa to be between 0.5 and 1.0. This allows this MSB to be re-purposed to indicate the sign of the number being encoded, with 0 meaning positive, and 1 meaning negative.</p>
<p>The mantissa then represents a number between 0.5 and <em>almost</em> 1 (in fact, about 0.99999999976716936)</p>
<p>The exponent <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> in the Spectrum implementation uses one byte to represent an integer exponent in the range -127 to +127, stored by subtracting <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from 128 (hex <code>80</code>).</p>
<p>These five bytes are stored in the Spectrum memory in this form:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>  B1  </th>
<th>B2</th>
<th>B3</th>
<th>B4</th>
<th>B5</th>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">

</tr>

</table>
<div id="floating-point-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Floating point example</h3>
<p>For example, to represent the number one-tenth in five bytes floating point format, we note that</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(0.1 = (4/5) \times 2^{-3}\)</span></p>
<p>with an exponent of -3, and a mantissa of <span class="math inline">\(4/5 = 0.8\)</span>, which in fractional binary is:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((4/5) = (1/2) + (1/4) + (1/32) + (1/64) + (1/512) + (1/1024)...\)</span></p>
<p>giving a mantissa of</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(.11001100\text{_}11001100\text{_}11001100\text{_}11001100\)</span> in binary, and <code>CC_CC_CC_CC</code> in hexadecimal bytes</p>
<p>Since we want to represent <em>positive</em> one-tenth, the most significant bit of the manitssa (left-most bit of <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span>) is set to zero, so we represent +0.1 in five bytes as:</p>
<p><code>83_4C_CC_CC_CC</code>
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="smallest-and-largest-numbers" class="section level3">
<h3>Smallest and largest numbers</h3>
<p>Using this system, the ZX Spectrum can represent positive and negative numbers with these extremes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Extreme</th>
<th>  Hex Form  </th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>smallest positive number</td>
<td><code>FF00000000</code></td>
<td>2.93873587706e-39</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>largest positive number</td>
<td><code>017FFFFFFF</code></td>
<td>1.7014118e+38</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>smallest negative number</td>
<td><code>FF80000000</code></td>
<td>5.87747175411e-39</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>largest negative number</td>
<td><code>01FFFFFFFF</code></td>
<td>-1.7014118e+38</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that for floating point numbers, the byte B1 representing the exponent cannot take the value <code>00</code>. This is a reserved marker indicating that a 16-bit signed integer is actually embedded within the 5-byte format as:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>  B1  </th>
<th>B2</th>
<th>B3</th>
<th>B4</th>
<th>B5</th>

<td><span class="math inline">\(XX\)</span>  </td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(YY\)</span>  </td>
<td><code>00</code>  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(XXYY\)</span> is the two’s complement signed 16-bit integer (i.e. in the range -32768 to +32677)</p>
<p>Note that the exact number zero cannot be represented in this floating point format, since there is no way that <span class="math inline">\(2^e=0\)</span> unless <span class="math inline">\(e \rightarrow -\infty\)</span>. Zero is instead represented by an integer padded in the five-byte form as <code>00FF000000</code></p>
<hr>
</div>
</div>
<div id="supported-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Supported Functions</h2>
<p>So now we know how the ZX stored floating point values using a 5-byte format.</p>
<p>The ZX Spectrum supports the following ten trigonometric and exponential functions:</p>
<p><strong>SIN   COS   TAN   ARCSIN   ARCCOS   ARCTAN   LN   EXP   SQRT</strong>   <strong>POW</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>ARC</strong> commands are simply the inverse trig functions. <strong>POW</strong> is raising one number to the power of another, and is the only binary operator, with the rest unary.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="mathematical-magic-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Mathematical Magic #1</h3>
<p>Four of these are “fundamental” operators:</p>
<p><strong>EXP   LN   SIN   ARCTAN</strong></p>
<p>The other six operators are defined in terms of these four fundamental operator. Some of these definitions are simple, but some use quite crafty conversions and mathematical identities!</p>
<p><strong>COS</strong>   <span class="math inline">\(\pm cos(x) = sin(x \pm \pi/2)\)</span></p>
<p><strong>TAN</strong>   <span class="math inline">\(\pm tan(x) = \large \frac{sin(x)}{\pm cos(x)} = \large \frac {sin(x)}{sin( x \pm \pi/2)}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>POW</strong>   <span class="math inline">\(x^y = e^{ln(x^y)} = e^{y \times ln(x)}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>SQRT</strong>   <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt(x) = x^{0.5} = e^{0.5 \times ln(x)}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>ARCSIN</strong>   <span class="math inline">\(sin^{-1}(x) =2 \times tan^{-1}(\large \frac{x}{\sqrt(1-x^2)})\)</span></p>
<p><strong>ARCCOS</strong>   <span class="math inline">\(cos^{-1}(x) = \pi/2 - sin^{-1}(x)\)</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Note that the <strong>ARCSIN</strong> calculation uses this form of a half-angle trig identity:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(tan(\large \frac{\theta}{2}) = \large \frac{sin(\theta)}{1+cos(\theta)}\)</span></p>
<p>and also uses a Pythagorean identity:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(sin^2(\theta) + cos^2(\theta) = 1\)</span></p>
<p>rearranged to give</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(cos(\theta) = \sqrt(1-sin^2(\theta))\)</span></p>
<p>By using only four operators to derive a total of ten, the ZX Spectrum creators were very cleverly able to keep memory usage down, albeit at the cost of slower speed with multiple conversions using existing routines for the four “base” operators.</p>

<div id="where-the-magic-happens-chebyshev-approximations" class="section level2">
<h2>Where the magic happens: Chebyshev Approximations</h2>
<p>We have just seen how the ZX Spectrum handles ten functions for the price of only four. The question is, how does it actually implement these four functions using the simple-minded Z80 CPU and a tiny amount of ROM?</p>
<p>Step forward the Chebyshev Polynomial Series approximation!!</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="chebyshev-the-man." class="section level3">
<h3>Chebyshev, the man.</h3>
<p><img src="../../../../images/pafnuty.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pafnuty Chebyshev was a Russian mathematician and all-round mega-brain that died shortly before the twentieth century. He has over a dozen mathematical and mechanics related equations, relations, functions and mechanisms named after him. Of particular interest in this article are Chebyshev Polynomials, specifically “of the first kind”.</p>
<p>The mathematics get’s a bit heavy, so I’ll leave it as a study exercise for the interested reader. There are some well-written resources in the references at the end of this article. Here, we’ll just stick to how a truncated series of these polynomials can be used to finely approximate functions like <strong>EXP</strong>, <strong>LN</strong>, <strong>SIN</strong> and <strong>ARCTAN</strong>, allowing the little Speccy to crunch the numbers and allow young programmers like I was to write BASIC programs that drew fractals, circles, ellipses and solve maths homework.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="chebyshev-the-polynomials." class="section level3">
<h3>Chebyshev, the polynomials.</h3>
<p>In a nut-shell, Chebyshev polynomials (<span class="math inline">\(T_n(x)\)</span>) are those that fulfill the relation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_n(x)=cos(ncos^{-1}(x))\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n=0,1,2,3,...\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_n(x)\)</span> is the nth “Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind”</p>
<p>The first couple of polynomials are dead easy!</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_0(x)=cos(0 \times cos^{-1}(x)) = cos(0) = 1\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_1(x)=cos(1 \times cos^{-1}(x)) = cos(cos^{-1}(x)) = x\)</span></p>
<p>From the third polnomial onwards, it gets tricky:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_2(x)=cos(2 \times cos^{-1}(x)) = \: ?\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_2(x)=cos(3 \times cos^{-1}(x)) = \: ?!?\)</span></p>
<p>But it turns out that there is a recurrence relation that allows you to compute the (n+1)th polynomial, when you already know the nth and (n-1)th, avoiding all the hard work!</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_{n+1}(x) = 2 x T_n(X) - T_{n-1}(x)\)</span></p>
<p>Since we know <span class="math inline">\(T_0(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_1(x)\)</span> already, then:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_2(x)= 2 \times x \times T_1(x) -T_0(x) = 2 \times x \times x - 1 = 2x^2-1\)</span></p>
<p>and by the same token, we can find <span class="math inline">\(T_3(x)\)</span> and so on. The first twelve Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are shown below:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_0(x) = 1 \\ T_1(x) = x \\ T_2(x) = 2x^2 − 1 \\ T_3(x) = 4x^3 − 3x \\ T_4(x) = 8x^4 − 8x^2 + 1 \\ T_5(x) = 16x^5 − 20x^3 + 5x \\ T_6(x) = 32x^6 − 48x^4 + 18x^2 − 1 \\ T_7(x) = 64x^7 − 112x^5 + 56x^3 − 7x \\ T_8(x) = 128x^8 − 256x^6 + 160x^4 − 32x^2 + 1 \\ T_9(x) = 256x^9 − 576x^7 + 432x^5 − 120x^3 + 9x \\ T_{10}(x) = 512x^{10} − 1280x^8 + 1120x^6 − 400x^4 + 50x^2 − 1 \\ T_{11}(x) = 1024x^{11} − 2816x^9 + 2816x^7 − 1232x^5 + 220x^3 − 11x\)</span></p>
<p>The first five polynomials look like this over the range <span class="math inline">\(-1 \leq x \leq +1\)</span>:
<br>
<img src="../../../../images/chebyshev_polynomials_graph.png" /></p>
<p>Note that outside this limited range for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, these polynomials generally go crazy disappearing off to extreme values, so we really must stick with them only within our limited range.</p>
<p>These polynomials have many interesting properties, but what we care about is that over the range <span class="math inline">\(-1 \leq x \leq +1\)</span>, we can very closely approximate <em>some other</em> function as a linear combination of the first few Chebyshev polynomials.</p>
<p>To put this another way, by adding together certain scaled “amounts” of the first few polynomials, we get an overall function that looks a lot like, say, the <strong>SIN</strong> function for example. To express this mathematically:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(x) \approx \sum_{n=0}^{n=k-1}A_nT_n(x)\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> is a simple scalar coefficient that “scales” how much of each of the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> polynomials <span class="math inline">\(T_n(x)\)</span> to add together.</p>
<p>This is very much like Fourier synthesis, in which any repetitive waveform can be “built up” from various differing amounts of harmonically related single frequencies.</p>
<p>In our case, we have <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=sin(x)\)</span>, and since we know what each <span class="math inline">\(T_n(x)\)</span>, up to <span class="math inline">\(n=11\)</span> in the above list, then if only we could find out what each number <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> is, we could approximate <strong>SIN</strong> as some simple sum of say the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> polynomials, i.e.:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(sin(x) \approx A_0T_0(x) + ... + A_kT_k(x)\)</span></p>
<p>Since each <span class="math inline">\(T_n(x)\)</span> is just some polynomial in powers of x, we <em>could</em> add up all the “amounts” of each power of x, and end up with coefficients, say <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(sin(x) \approx a_0x^0 + a_1x^1 + a_2x^2 + ... + a_kx^k = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + .... + a_kx^k\)</span></p>
<p>However, it is easier just to add up the Chebyshev polynomials directly, and this is how the ZX Spectrum does it.</p>
<p>Going back a step, and skipping the derivations which you can find else where, the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> can be found using:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A_0 = \large \frac{1}{\pi} \large \int_{-1}^{+1} \large \frac{f(x)dx}{\sqrt(1-x^2)}\)</span></p>
<p>and for <span class="math inline">\(n=1,2,3...k\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A_n = \large \frac{2}{\pi}\large \int_{-1}^{1} \large \frac{f(x)T_n(x)dx}{\sqrt(1-x^2)}\)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="scaling-in-x" class="section level3">
<h3>Scaling in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></h3>
<p>Before we get carried away and launch in to some number crunching, we have to bear in mind that the approximations above work only over the range <span class="math inline">\(-1 \leq x \leq +1\)</span> as stressed already. Outside this, the approximation fall apart, and the sum of polynomials will not “follow” or mimic our chosen funtion <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> anymore.</p>
<p>Scaling to the rescue! For our chosen <strong>SIN</strong> function, we can compress a full cycle of <strong>SIN</strong> from say <span class="math inline">\(-\pi/2 \leq x \leq \pi/2\)</span> to our desired <span class="math inline">\(-1 \leq x&#39; \leq +1\)</span> if we let <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow x&#39;\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;= x / (\pi)\)</span>.</p>

<div id="approximating-sin" class="section level3">
<h3>Approximating <strong>SIN</strong></h3>
<p>Now we’ll use the above two equations for the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> to put R to work, doing a numerical integration for us to find these coefficients to approximate the <strong>SIN</strong> function, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=sin(x&#39;)\)</span>. We’ll do this for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> up to 5 to start with.</p>
<p>Remembering that <span class="math inline">\(T_0(x) = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> says how much “offset” - or for the electrical/electronics engineers out there, how much “DC” - we want in our composite of polynomials. <strong>SIN</strong> over full cycles has an average of zero, or no offset or “DC” component, so we may expect <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span> to be zero.

x &lt;- seq(-1,1,length.out = 100)
max_error &lt;- numeric()
for (i in 1:3) {
  sin_approx &lt;- rep(0,100)
  for (i in seq(2,(2*i+4),by=2)) {
    sin_approx &lt;- sin_approx + A[i]*Tn[[i]](x)
  }
  max_error &lt;- c(max_error, max(sin(x*pi) - sin_approx))
}
max_error</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7.060408e-03 2.555824e-04 5.913220e-06</code></pre>
<p>We see the error rapidly reduce, from about 7000ppm (or 0.7%) with three odd numbered coefficients (<span class="math inline">\(T_1(x), T_3(x), T_5(x)\)</span>) down to about 6ppm (0.0006%) with five.</p>
<p>Can we do better though? One issue with the approximation derived above is that it needs polynommials <span class="math inline">\(T_1(x), T_3(x), T_5(x), T_7(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_9(x)\)</span>. i.e. powers of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> up to 9. This is pretty high, and may introduce significant floating point rounding errors. We would prefer to keep the power of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> lower!</p>
<p>In the ZX Spectrum, a slightly different formulation of the Chebyshev polynomials is used, called the Shifted Chebyshev Polynomial.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-shifted-form" class="section level3">
<h3>The Shifted Form</h3>
<p>The Shifted Chebyshev polynomial is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(T^*_n(x)\)</span>, and is defined:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T^*_n(x) = T_n(2x-1)\)</span></p>
<p>So that the first few shifted polynomials are:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_0(x) = 1 \\ T_1(x) = 2x-1 \\ T_2(x) = 8x^2 − 8x + 1 \\ T_3(x) = 32x^3 −48x^2 + 18x - 1 \\ T_4(x) = 128x^4 -256x^3 + 160x^2 -32x + 1\)</span></p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>The ZX Spectrum creators likely had a copy of Abramowitz and Stegun’s massively chunky reference tome, a <em>“Handbook of Mathematical Functions”</em> published by Dover in 1965. Page 76 is possibly where the ZX Spectrum gets its implementation from, and an excerpt is shown below. This method only requires up to T_5(x), i.e. only the fifth power of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is used, decreasing floating point rounding errors.</p>
<p><br>
<img src="../../../../images/dover1965.jpg" alt="image_medium" /></p>
<p>Code that implements this method is given here:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>As=c(1.276278962,-0.285261569,0.009118016,-0.000136587,0.000001185,-0.000000007)

Ts0 &lt;- function(x) 1
Ts1 &lt;- function(x) 2*x-1
Ts2 &lt;- function(x) 8*x^2-8*x+1
Ts3 &lt;- function(x) 32*x^3-48*x^2+18*x-1
Ts4 &lt;- function(x) 128*x^4-256*x^3+16*x^2-32*x+1
Ts5 &lt;- function(x) 512*x^5-1280*x^4+1120*x^3-400*x^2+50*x-1

Tsn = list(Ts0,Ts1,Ts2,Ts3,Ts4,Ts5)


x &lt;- seq(-1,1,length.out = 40)
sin_approx &lt;- rep(0,length(x))
for (i in 1:6) {
  sin_approx &lt;- sin_approx + As[i]*Tsn[[i]](x^2)
}
plot(x, x*sin_approx, col=&quot;blue&quot;, pch=1)
lines(x,sin(pi*x/2), col=&quot;red&quot;, type=&quot;l&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/how-the-humble-spectrum-handled-trig_files/figure-html/from_handbook-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Again, let’s take a look at the maximum error between this truncated shifted polynomial series approximation, and a true sin() function - assuming R on a modern 64bit PC is <strong>much</strong> more accurate than a ZX Spectrum!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># what is error with 6 coefficients using the shifted form?
x &lt;- seq(-1,1,length.out = 100)
max_error &lt;- numeric()
sin_approx &lt;- rep(0,100)
for (i in 1:6) {
  sin_approx &lt;- sin_approx + As[i]*Tsn[[i]](x^2)
}
sin_approx &lt;- x* sin_approx
max_error &lt;- c(max_error, max(sin(pi*x/2) - sin_approx))

# show maximum error
max_error</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.00017064</code></pre>
<p>The maximum error is about 170ppm (or 0.017%). This is a lot higher than our approximation using the unshifted polynomials <span class="math inline">\(T_n(x)\)</span> up to the ninth power of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, however, it would be quicker for the Spectrum to compute, with less worry about rounding errors from so many repeated multiplications for these high powers.</p>
