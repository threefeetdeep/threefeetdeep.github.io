      <p>Needing an outdoor light by our front door, but - despite being an electronics engineer and weirdly averse to, and fearful of 240V mains electricity - I decided to create a custom battery powered Passive-Infrared (PIR) sensor and LED light. This avoided the need for drilling holes from inside to outside, and adding a stub from the indoor lighting mains ring.</p>
<p>I had a few old car and motorbike batteries spare. One could be re-purposed to power the outdoor light! But 
we have a north facing front door, ruling out solar powered recharging of a battery. Recharging every 6 months or so wouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a pain, so I designed an analogue circuit to switch the light on when motion is detected by the PIR, whilst only drawing about 0.5mA in &ldquo;standby&rdquo; at night, and much less in the daytime.</p>
<p>The schematic can be found <a href="../../../../files/let_there_be_light/LTBL_Schematic_v1p0.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I designed the board to fit into the housing from an old mains-powered PIR, using spare parts I had available at home, like an LM324 quad-Opamp, CD40106 hex Schmitt inverter, and some discrete BJTs and FETs. Of course, it would have been simpler to use a microcontroller, but being a bit old school with a liking for analogue electronics, I decided to do it this way.</p>
<p>I used the impressive free PCB design tool KiCad. Here&rsquo;s an output from KiCad of the PCB:</p>

<p>It would be a shame if EVERYTHING new in this world is digital! An inspiring books that&rsquo;s a bit of a &lsquo;modern classic&rsquo; about the spirit of analogue electronics design can be found in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Analog-Circuit-Design-Engineers/dp/0750670622">&ldquo;The art and science of analogue circuit design&rdquo;</a>, edited by a legend of analogue electronics, Jim Williams. The book is worth it for the cover design itself!</p>
