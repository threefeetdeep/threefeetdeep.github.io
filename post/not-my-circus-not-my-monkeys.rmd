My wife is Polish, which means she doesn't mince her words, and can be very direct, issuing requests and commands without the usual English fluff; "Would you mind doing...", "Could you...", "Have you thought about doing...". 

Despite this directness of language, it turns out that the Poles have some wonderfully vivid and imaginative idioms and phrases in everyday use. I decided to document a small selection here, to give you an impression of the colourful Polish language.

|**Polish:**      |&emsp;|*być głupim jak but*|  
|**Translation:** |&emsp;|to be as stupid as a shoe|
|**Example:**     |&emsp;|"My husband is as stupid as a shoe."|
|**Equivalents:** |&emsp;| dead from the neck up|
|                 |&emsp;| thick as two short planks|

|**Polish:**      |&emsp;|*zrobili mnie w konia*|  
|**Translation:** |&emsp;|I was made into a horse|
|**Example:**     |&emsp;|"He said he'd shower me with presents after we got | 
|                 |&emsp;|married, but I was made into a horse."|
|**Equivalents:** |&emsp;| pull the wool over his eyes|
|                 |&emsp;| lead him up the garden path|
|                 |&emsp;| taken for a ride|

|**Polish:**      |&emsp;|*mieć muchy w nosie*|  
|**Translation:** |&emsp;|to have flies up his nose|
|**Example:**     |&emsp;|"Leave him be; he has flies up his nose!"|
|**Equivalents:** |&emsp;| he's like a bear with a sore head|

|**Polish:**      |&emsp;|*ma węża w kieszeni*|  
|**Translation:** |&emsp;|he has a snake in his pocket|
|**Example:**     |&emsp;|"Him, buy me ring!? He's got a snake in his pocket!"|
|**Equivalents:** |&emsp;|he's as tight as a duck's arse|
<br>
You would be reluctant to put your hand in your own pocket if you knew that it contained a dealy snake waiting to bite you, wouldn't you?

On the other hand, if a duck's butthole wasn't tight, it would allow the duck to fill with water and sink...

|**Polish:**      |&emsp;|*małe piwo*|  
|**Translation:** |&emsp;|small beer|
|**Example:**     |&emsp;|"Knock you up a quick meal? Small beer!"|
|**Equivalents:** |&emsp;|piece of cake|
|                 |&emsp;|easy peasy|

|**Polish:**      |&emsp;|*małe piwo*|  
|**Translation:** |&emsp;|pears on a willow tree|
|**Example:**     |&emsp;|"Do all the housework for a week?|
|                 |&emsp;|I think he's promising you pears on a willow tree."|
|**Equivalents:** |&emsp;|pay lip service|
|                 |&emsp;|jam tomorrow|

Promising pears from a willow tree, a fine example of the earthy, rustic imagery employed in may Polish sayings.

"Jam tomorrow" originates from Lewis Carroll's *Through The Looking Glass*, in which the White Queen offers Alice *"jam tomorrow, jam yesterday, but **never** jam today*.

|**Polish:**      |&emsp;|*Nie moj cyrk, nie moje małpy*|

|**Example:**     |&emsp;|"Tidy up your big, fat mess? Not my cirus, not my monkeys!"|
|**Equivalents:** |&emsp;|it's not my problem, mate|

My favourite idiom: It's your chaotic, farcical creation, nothing to do with me! Is there an equivalent idiom as colourful as this one in English?
