When I first started learning R early in 2020, it cames as a bit of a suprise that there were functions in base R for calculating the mean and median, but not the mode. Well, there is a function `mode()`, but it returns the storage mode of an R object!

Of course, the mean only operates on numeric data, as does the R `median()` function. But we could take the mode of a collection of pretty much any objects, numeric, factor, or otherwise.

A few times, I found myself needing a simple function to return the mode. Here are a couple  options, first tested on numeric input:

```{r}
my_mode_1 <- function(x) {
	unique(x)[which.max(tabulate(match(x,unique(x))))]
}

my_mode_2 <- function(x) {
	which.max(sapply(1:max(x), function(n) {length(which(x==n))}))
}
```

```{r}
x <- c(6,3,9,6,6,5,9,3)

my_mode_1(x)
my_mode_2(x)
```
note that if there was a tie, the first function returns the *first* tied value, whereas the second function returns the numerically lower value.

The second function doesn't operate on factors as it uses the max() function, which only works on numeric values:
```{r}
x <- factor(c("a","a","b","c"))

my_mode_1(x)
```

So, next time you need to find the mode in R, grab one of these simple functions :-)
