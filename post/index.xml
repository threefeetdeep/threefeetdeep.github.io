      <description>Randomness in the electronic ageA short essay on randomness in the modern age:why we need/use ithow we generate it
How can you tell if something is really random?Randomness essentially means “no pattern” or predictabilityRandomness is not just uniformDiehard tests - runs, monkey, birthday spacingsTestU01
‘Pseudo-random’ is usually random enoughGood enough for many things.Cryptograhically secure
Software as a source of randomnessCyclical sequences and modular arithmeticThe Mersenne TwisterBrief backgroundVery common across operating systems and applications</description>

      <description>My first foray into reinforcement learningSupervised and unsupervised learning are the backbone of today’s machine learning solutions, but reinforcement learning is the technique that makes you envisage androids, Terminator, Skynet, and the rise of the machines!
One of the “Hello World!” toy examples in reinforcement learning is to teach an computer ‘agent’ to play pong from scratch, in this case in a Python script.
Reward, or carrot and stickReinforcement learning uses principles similar to those that we might use when we humans learn.</description>

      <description>Please tell me when to cover my carWouldn’t it be nice if there was a smartphone app that alerted me the evening before a potentially frosty morning, to prompt me to go and put the covers on the car windscreen, saving me checking the forecast each day?
There wasn’t so I thought I would have a go myself. I had previously written a very basic Hello World!</description>

      <description>My wife is Polish, which means she doesn’t mince her words, and can be very direct, issuing requests and commands without the usual English fluff; “Would you mind doing…”, “Could you…”, “Have you thought about doing…”.
Despite this directness of language, it turns out that the Poles have some wonderfully vivid and imaginative idioms and phrases in everyday use. I decided to document a small selection here, to give you an impression of the colourful Polish language.</description>

      <description>Doing a lot with a littleThe ZX Spectrum played a big part in my childhood, swallowing up whole chunks of time - hours days weeks at a time - both through gaming, and painstaking programming in assembly language to create incredibly primitive games.
As I got older, and became an electronics engineer, this humble little home computer from the 1980’s amazed me over and over as I learned more and more about its inner workings.</description>

      <description>Every now and then, especially when I&amp;rsquo;m working my way through a weeks worth of ironing, I think to myself, &amp;lsquo;is there anything I could watch on YouTube that might expand my mind a little, to ease the pain of endless ironing?&amp;rsquo;. Of course, there is. YouTube appears as an infinite repository of content, ranging from the most gloriously intriguing content to utter pointlessness. And kittens.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a little taster of the kind of YouTube content that has blown my mind&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Needing an outdoor light by our front door, but - despite being an electronics engineer and weirdly averse to, and fearful of 240V mains electricity - I decided to create a custom battery powered Passive-Infrared (PIR) sensor and LED light. This avoided the need for drilling holes from inside to outside, and adding a stub from the indoor lighting mains ring.
I had a few old car and motorbike batteries spare.</description>

      <description>I recently completed the Coursera / Johns Hopkins University &amp;ldquo;Data Science Specialization&amp;rdquo;, a series of ten courses culminating in a Capstone project in which we students had to develop a text-prediction application. This was to be demonstrated in a Shiny App. Below is my &amp;ldquo;promotional slide deck&amp;rdquo; for this text-prediction application. Shiny is a powerful framework for deploying interactive R web apps, but I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit of a noob when it come&amp;rsquo;s to creating a polished app - to be worked upon!</description>

      <description>R Markdown Throughout my ongoing journey of discovery and learning in statistics and data science , my mainstay computing environment has been the R Studio IDE.
I found initially that it is quite hard to include R markdown output in blogging sites like WordPress. This led me to create my own website from scratch (in simple HTML,CSS and JavaScript) but this rapidly become cumbersome to maintain, even as a static site.</description>

      <description>Not a reference to sexual abuse, just an enticing article name to lure you in&amp;hellip;
This article is inspired by this BBC new article about a village losing their broadband due to an old, and very electrically noisy TV set&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent much of my working life as a practicing RF engineer, and know firsthand just how challenging it can be to troubleshoot these kind of &amp;ldquo;EMC&amp;rdquo;, or electromagnetic compatibility problems.</description>

      <description>When I first started learning R early in 2020, it cames as a bit of a suprise that there were functions in base R for calculating the mean and median, but not the mode. Well, there is a function mode(), but it returns the storage mode of an R object!
Of course, the mean only operates on numeric data, as does the R median() function. But we could take the mode of a collection of pretty much any objects, numeric, factor, or otherwise.</description>

      <description>It may be a bit square to refer to keep a library of books in this day and age, but I find books to be reassuringly apocalypse-resistant repositories of knowledge, often with far clearer and more understandable explanations than you&amp;rsquo;ll find on most statistics and data science web pages. Here&amp;rsquo;s a small sample of my statistics books:
 &amp;ldquo;Applied Statistics: Principles and Examples&amp;rdquo; by D.R.Cox and E.J.Snell (Chapman &amp;amp; Hall, 1981) &amp;ldquo;Problem Solving: A Statistician&amp;rsquo;s Guide&amp;rdquo; by C.</description>
