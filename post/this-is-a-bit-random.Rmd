## Randomness in the electronic age
A short essay on randomness in the modern age:
why we need/use it
how we generate it

## How can you tell if something is *really*  random?
Randomness essentially means "no pattern" or predictability
Randomness is not just uniform
Diehard tests - runs, monkey, birthday spacings
TestU01


## 'Pseudo-random' is usually random enough
Good enough for many things. 
Cryptograhically secure

## Software as a source of randomness

### Cyclical sequences and modular arithmetic

### The Mersenne Twister
Brief background
Very common across operating systems and applications


## Hardware as a source of randomness
Most common real random is thermal noise

### Linear feedback shift register
For PRNGs

### Thermal noise
e.g. MEM, diode noise,

### Other sources of real world chaos
Light (ERNIE 5)
Lavalamps to fishtanks, chaotic systems

## Randomness and quantum computing
