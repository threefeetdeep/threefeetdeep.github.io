## The ZX is not a calculator
The ZX Spectrum played a big part in my childhood, swallowing up whole chunks of time -  hours days weeks at a time - both through gaming, and painstaking programming in assembly language to create incredibly primitive games.

As I got older, and became an electronics engineer, this humble little home computer from the 1980's amazed me more and more as I learnt more about its inner workings. The functionalilty that the ZX Spectrum's creators extracted out of such a limited number of transistors, both in terms of CPU and memory, and low clock speed (3.154MHz) is astounding. 

A pocket calculator has one job, to do maths, and has an incredibly specific and customised microchip "brain" for that sole purpose. The ZX spectrum was a low cost, general purpose home computer made from general purpose microchips (ignoring the ULA, but that's another story...), where mathematical manipulation had to be handled with extreme guile and care !

## Z80: Putting the "Z" in "ZX"
The digital, integer-number-crunching heart of the the ZX Spectrum is the 8-bit Zilog Z80 microprocessor, or CPU. In terms of the raw mathematical ability, it can:

* add  or subtract 8- and 16-bit integers
* multiply or divide 8- or 16-bit integers by powers of 2

and that is pretty much it! No dedicated floating point unit, no hardware multipliers, no maths co-processor.
 
So the question is, how does such a simple home computer using a CPU with such basic mathematical abilities perform quite precise floating-point trigonometrical functions like sine, and arctangent?

## Every byte counts
The Z80 could address 64kB of memory. The ZX Spectrum has 48kB of RAM. In the remaining 16kB, the ZX Specrum had to cram the entire operating system, which included:

* reset/restart tables
* tables of constants e.g. pixel maps for characters.
* keyboard handling of key presses, scanned at 50Hz
* loudspeaker routines to make beeps at precise frequencies
* cassette handling for loading and saving data
* screen and printer output handling
* BASIC interpreter routines
* expression evaluation routines
* arithmetic routines
* floating point calculator

Every single byte in ROM mattered. This becomes an important consideration when looking at how the humble speccy handled trigonometrical and exponential functions.

## Floating-point numbers in Spectrum-Land
It is worth a brief description of how the ZX Spectrum stored floating point numbers in memory. They were stored using five bytes.

Any number (except 0) can be written uniquely as:

$\pm mantissa \times 2^{e}$


In the ZX Spectrum, $mantissa$ is made up of the four bytes $m_1$ to $m_4$, expressed as a fractional integer, as illustrated here using only four bits after the decimal point The ZX Spectrum uses 32 bits.

![image_medium](../../../../images/fractional_binary.gif)

The Spectrum ROM code assumes that the left-most (most-significant) bit of the mantissa would be a one, with a value of 0.5. This allows this bit to be re-purposed to indicate the sign of the number being encoded, with 0 meaning positive, and 1 meaning negative.

The mantissa then represents a number between 0.5 and *almost* 1 (in fact, about 0.99999999976716936)

The exponent $e$ in the Spectrum implementation uses one byte to represent an integer exponent in the range -127 to +127, stored by subtracting $e$ from 128 (hex `80`).

These five bytes are stored in the Spectrum memory in this form:

|&nbsp; B1 &nbsp;|B2|B3|B4|B5|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|$128-e$ &ensp;|$m_1$ &ensp;|$m_2$ &ensp;|$m_3$ &ensp;|$m_4$ &ensp;|

### Floating point example
For example, to represent the number one-tenth in five bytes floating point format, we note that

$0.1 = (4/5) \times 2^{-3}$ 

with an exponent of -3, and a mantissa of $4/5 = 0.8$, which in fractional binary is:

$(4/5) = (1/2) + (1/4) + (1/32) + (1/64) + (1/512) + (1/1024)...$

giving a mantissa of

$.11001100\text{_}11001100\text{_}11001100\text{_}11001100$ in binary, and `CC_CC_CC_CC` in hexadecimal bytes

Since we want to represent *positive* one-tenth, the most significant bit of the manitssa (left-most bit of $m_1$) is set to zero, so we represent +0.1 in five bytes as:

`83_4C_CC_CC_CC`

### Smallest and largest numbers

Using this system, the ZX Spectrum can represent positive and negative numbers with these extremes:

| Extreme | &ensp; Hex Form &ensp; | Value |
|---------|----------|-------|
|smallest positive number|`FF00000000`|2.93873587706e-39|
|largest positive number|`007FFFFFFF`|1.7014118e+38|
|smallest negative number|`FF80000000`|5.87747175411e-39|
|largest negative number|`00FFFFFFFF`|-1.7014118e+38|

Note that for floating point numbers, the byte B1 representing the exponent cannot take the value `00`. This is a reserved marker indicating that a 16-bit signed integer is actually embedded within the 5-byte format as:

|&nbsp; B1 &nbsp;|B2|B3|B4|B5|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|`00` &ensp;|`FF` &ensp;|$XX$ &ensp;|$YY$ &ensp;|`00` &ensp;|

where $XXYY$ is the two's complement signed 16-bit integer (i.e. in the range -32768 to +32677)

Note that the exact number zero cannot be represented in this floating point format, since the matissa must *always* be at least 0.5. Zero is instead represented by an integer padded in the five-byte form as `00FF000000`

## Supported Functions
So now we know how the ZX stored floating point values using a 5-byte format.

The ZX Spectrum supports the following trigonometric- and exponential-based functions:

**SIN &ensp; COS &ensp; TAN &ensp; ARCSIN &ensp; ARCCOS &ensp; ARCTAN &ensp; LN &ensp; EXP &ensp; SQRT**

Four of these are "fundamental" functions, used to derive the others:

**EXP &ensp; LN &ensp; SIN &ensp; ARCTAN**

The derivations are:

**COS** &emsp; $\pm cos(x) = sin(x \pm \pi/2)$

**TAN** &emsp; $\pm tan(x) = \frac{sin(x)}{\pm cos(x)} = \frac {sin(x)}{sin( x \pm \pi/2)}$

**ARCSIN** &emsp; $sin^{-1}(x) = $

**

Here's a simple function to the hex format as stored in memory to the floating point number it represents:
```{r, conversion_functions}
hex_to_float <- function(hex_in) {
  # strip exponent
  exponent <- as.integer(as.hexmode(str_sub(hex_in,1,2)))
  
  # strip mantissa (as 16-bit chunks; as.hexmode() range limits!)
  mantissa_high <- as.integer(as.hexmode(str_sub(hex_in,3,6)))
  mantissa_low <- as.integer(as.hexmode(str_sub(hex_in,7,10)))
  mantissa <- mantissa_low + 2^16*mantissa_high
  
  # mantissa sign (most significant bit of four bytes)
  msign <- 1*(mantissa_high <= 2^15)
  
  # calculate output float
  (2*msign-1) * 2^(128-exponent) * (mantissa+2^31*msign)/2^32
}

# 0.1
hex_to_float("834CCCCCCC")

options(digits=8)

# smallest positive
hex_to_float("FF00000000")
#largest positive
hex_to_float("017FFFFFFF")



# smallest negative
hex_to_float("FF80000000")
#largest negative
hex_to_float("01FFFFFFFF")

# half of pi?
hex_to_float("81490FDAA2")

```


The spectrum ROM uses these coefficients for the Chebyshev polynomial approximation, stored in ROM at 0x37BE to 0x37D6:
```{r}
sin_coefs <- list('64e6000000','6c1f0b0000',
                  '738f38ee00','791563bb23',
                  '7e920dcded','81235d1bea')
lapply(sin_coefs,FUN=hex_to_float)
```


## ZX Spectrum floating point range
TBD. What is smallest and largest positive and negative numbers that speecy cna handle in float format? Can it handle 0.000000000 in float?
